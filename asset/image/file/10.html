## Cheaper alternatives to Online loans

If you still absolutely NEED to borrow to plug a short-term hole in your finances, don't automatically assume you're frozen out by ‘normal' banks, and that payday loans are your only option. The methods below may be able to give you what you need instead of a payday loan. We've listed them in rough order of which to try first - though scan all of them before making a decision to see what's suitable.

The aim is to replicate as closely as possible the speedy result you get from a payday lender, while costing less. 

**Help if you've already got a payday loan.** In each of the methods below we list how it can be used to pay off a payday loan, so you can ditch it and get out of the cycle. We wouldn't normally suggest paying off debt with other debt, but in comparison to payday loans most of the other credit products we suggest are not so bad. 

*   ### 1\. A 0% credit card is the cheapest option, even for poorer credit scorers

    If you need to borrow money, doing it interest-free is the best way. There are plenty of 0% credit cards available and the right one for you depends on what you need the money for. Applications take between one and three weeks. Here's what you need to know.

    **If you need the loan to buy something.** Simply get the card, then use it to purchase whatever it is the intended payday loan was for.

    **If you need the loan for cash.** Don't withdraw cash on these cards - that won't be at the 0% and there'll be a fee. Instead, use one for your normal spending (don't overspend and carefully budget). The equivalent amount of unspent income will build up in your bank account which can then be used as cash.

    #### What to go for depends on your credit score...

    *   ##### If you've a good credit score, go for the longest 0%

        Many cards offer over a year's 0%. This is worth considering if your credit score is decent as it means you have longer to repay, and can have the card ready in case you need to use the 0% again. For full help, see Top 0% Credit Cards - our Eligibility Calculator shows which ones you're likely to get.

    *   ##### If you've a poor credit score, there are still options to try

        A few deals are usually available for those with a poorer credit history. Yet these offer far shorter 0% deals, then again they still last longer than a payday loan.

        The rub is that these cards punish you harshly for overstaying your welcome. Once the 0% periods end for spending or debt shifted from other cards, the interest you'll be charged typically jumps to around 30%. So it's doubly important you try to repay these before that happens (though that still is likely to be cheaper than payday loans).

         For a full list, see Credit Cards For Bad Credit.

    **Important.** Regardless of the 0% spending card you go for, always follow these golden rules. 

    1.  Pay at _least_ the monthly minimum else you'll lose the 0% deal. 
    2.  Clear the card before the 0% ends, or you'll pay hefty interest. 
    3.  Don't transfer over a balance from another credit card as that's usually not at the cheap rate. If you are trying to clear expensive debts, you need different cards. See Best Balance Transfers.

    #### How to use a 0% card to pay off an existing payday loan

    These cards are the holy grail of paying off a payday loan cheaply. After all, if you need to borrow money, doing it interest-free is the best way. Here's what you need to know...

    *   ##### If you've a good credit score, use a 0% money transfer

        This is a relatively rare function of a few specialist cards where they pay cash into your bank account for you, for a small fee. You now have money in your account (use it to pay off the payday loan) and you've a debt on the card. Use the period at 0% to clear the debt from the card. For full help, see 0% Money Transfers.

    *   ##### If you've a poor credit score, try a 0% spending card

        You can still get a 0% card to help you pay off your payday loan, it's just going to be a bit more complex, as these are 0% on spending rather than on money transfers. But, importantly, they still give you a few months with no interest to allow you a bit of respite.

        If you can get one of these cards, use it to pay for everything you buy where cards are accepted - but don't overspend, and carefully budget. The equivalent amount of unspent income will build up in your bank account, which you should use to pay off the payday loan.

        Only see the 0% period as a respite, though. On these cards, once the 0% period ends, the interest you'll be charged typically jumps to around 30%.

         For a full list, see Credit Cards For Bad Credit.

*   ### 2\. Even a normal credit card offers interest-free spending, if you pay it off IN FULL

    If you spend on a credit card and CLEAR THE WHOLE CARD IN FULL next month, it's interest-free so there's nowt cheaper. So if you have this option, it's both the cheapest and easiest – as you needn't apply for anything.

    Two important warnings though…

    *   If you can't clear the card in full, you'll pay interest even if you clear the amount you were planning to borrow.
    *   This only applies to spending, not ATM cash withdrawals - you pay a fee and interest on those, so spending on a card is always cheaper than getting a cash advance.

    Even in these circumstances, provided you repay the debt in the same time as a payday loan – it's likely to be far cheaper.

    #### What if you can't clear it in full?

    If you don't have a card you can clear, and can't get any other form of credit that's cheaper, the next question is: do you have any credit card at all you can use? Almost every credit card, used right, is far cheaper than a payday loan.

    Of course, you'll need room on your credit limit. If you don't have any, speak to the card provider and see if it can increase it. If you try to spend over your credit limit you'll either be declined or will usually be charged a £12ish fee, which can be almost as costly as some payday loans.

    How to make best use of your card:

    *   **If your loan is to buy something.** Simply get the card, then use it to purchase whatever it is the loan was for, then make sure you repay this amount off the card in the same time as you were due to get the payday loan (eg, the next month).
    *   **If you need the loan for cash.** Don't withdraw cash on your credit card, as you'll pay interest even if you pay it off in full. Switch to using the credit card for your normal spending for the rest of the month (don't overspend and carefully budget). The equivalent amount of unspent income will be in your bank account, which can then be used as cash to make the purchase/pay the bill.  

        Again make sure you then repay your card the same time as you were due to repay the payday loan - this is usually less than a month.

    #### How to use a credit card to pay off an existing payday loan

    To pay off the payday loan, you need to use the credit card for your all normal spending for the rest of the month (don't overspend and carefully budget). The equivalent amount of unspent income will build up in your bank account, which can then be used as cash to pay off the loan

    Then pay off the card as quickly as possible - ideally the same month so you don't pay interest. If this isn't possible, then just pay it as fast as you can. A few months at 20% interest is much less than you'll pay on an equivalent payday loan.

    Warning: only spend on the card, don't make ATM cash withdrawals - you pay a fee and interest on those, so spending on a card is always cheaper than getting a cash advance.

    _No credit limit left? _If you're maxed out, speak to the card provider and see if it can increase it. If you try to spend over your credit limit you'll either be declined or will be charged a £12 fee, which can be almost as costly as some payday loans

*   ### 3\. Check if you're eligible for a 0% government loan of up to £812

    Though not a speedy option to get cash, some people may be able to qualify for the below.

    *   **Budgeting loans. **If you're on income-based benefits (such as income support, pension credit, employment & support allowance, jobseeker's allowance or universal credit), you may be able to get an interest-free loan of up to £812 for essential items for your home or other necessary things that you need a lump sum for such as rent, furniture, clothing or debt repayments. Repayments depend on what you can afford, though loans last for two years at most.  
        _  
        How to apply:_ Apply online at Gov.uk. Or, you can download the form from there, or pick one up from your nearest Jobcentre Plus.  

        Sadly there isn't a bottomless pit of money, so if it's decided your circumstances aren't urgent or you're not struggling, you may not get anything. But if you think you qualify and really need the cash, it's definitely worth a shot. You'll get a decision within 20 working days if you apply online - other ways take longer - then the money comes within a further 21 working days.
    *   **Hardship payments and advances if you're on universal credit.** If you're yet to receive your first universal credit payment (or your usual payment has been stopped or reduced) and you don't have enough money to live on, you can apply for an advance payment, which means you'll receive the initial amount early. It will then be automatically repaid back by the reduction of future universal credit payments. You can apply online or via a Jobcentre Plus. Full information at Gov.uk.
    *   **Emergency? Try local council support schemes: **Each local authority is responsible for providing help to residents struggling with an emergency.  

        Although each council's criteria are different, you'll need to be on income-based benefits to qualify, and priority's usually given to those on the lowest incomes.  

        This could include you or your family's health being at risk (eg, if your boiler's packed up mid-winter), not being able to afford to buy food, needing help to stay in your own home and coming out of care, hospital or prison.  

        Sadly, this is a postcode lottery. Each council can choose whether to offer financial help or not or who is eligible. For example, some may give furniture, clothing, white goods or food grants, some may give vouchers, while others may give cash. Contact your local council to find out its procedure.

    For more things to try, look at our Low Income Grants guide.

    #### How to use this to pay off an existing payday loan

    This may not be a solution for everyone, as most payday lenders won't lend to those on income-based benefits, and you need to be in receipt of these to qualify for a Government budgeting loan. But it may work if your circumstances have changed since you took out the payday loan. 

    If you've been on income-based benefits (such as universal credit or one of the legacy benefits income support, pension credit, employment & support allowance or jobseeker's allowance) for at least six months, you may be able to get an interest-free loan of £100-£812\. Technically, these loans are for essential items for your home or other necessary things that you need a lump sum for such as rent, furniture, clothing or debt repayments.

    You'll need to use the loan for the purpose it was intended for ie, essential items for your home. Meanwhile, use the other income you have that you're now not using for living expenses to pay off the payday loan. Repayments depend on what you can afford, though loans last for two years at most.

*   ### 4\. Turn to family for help

    Although borrowing from family (or a close friend) can be tricky, if you're in a bad way it may be worth asking for help, even if it's just going round for dinner to save on buying food. Plus, often talking about your money problems can be a huge relief (see the Debt-Free Wannabe board on the MSE forums).

    If someone will help you out, do it formally. Write down the amount and when you'll repay them. Hopefully they won't charge interest (or if they do, see if they'll accept a pint as thanks, or a token sum at the end of the loan).

    If it is a close family member (such as a parent) and they don't have the cash, but they do have a better credit score than you, then as long as they're willing, they could try some of the alternatives above to get the cash to lend to you. But they must be aware the debt is then legally theirs, not yours.

*   ### 5\. See if your local credit union will offer you a loan

    Credit unions and Community Development Finance Institutions are independently-run local co-operative organisations which aim to assist people who may not have access to financial products and services elsewhere. For many, they're a welcome and cheaper alternative to payday loans, often doing loans that are similar.

    Credit union loan rates are capped, and the maximum you can be charged on a loan is 42.6% APR (equivalent to 3% per month). Most loans are cheaper than this, and the highest rate is generally only used for very short term loans. 

    See the best buys for credit unions offering payday-style loans.

    #### How to use this to pay off an existing payday loan

    If you can find a local credit union doing payday-style loans, borrow cash from them to pay off your 1,000%+ APR payday loan, then you'll have between one and six months to pay the credit union back. 

*   ### 6\. Can you extend your overdraft? It's usually cheaper than a payday loan

    Usually we suggest people avoid using their overdraft facility if they'll incur interest. Yet even with high interest costs of around 40%, this is usually cheaper than a payday loan, especially if you can minimise the length of time you remain overdrawn,

    Our Best Bank Accounts guide tells you the best accounts if you're overdrawn - and some even have 0% overdrafts, which'll allow you time to sort out your finances.

    If you're already at your limit with overdrafts (and can't extend), have maxed out your credit card, and have a payday loan that you're struggling to pay off, then consider getting help with your debts. See the full Debt Help guide.

    #### How to use this to pay off an existing payday loan

    Use your overdraft to pay off all (or as much as possible) of your expensive payday loan, by making a card payment or bank transfer. You'll then be overdrawn by that amount and will owe your bank instead. 



### Or, get a credit union loan

Credit unions are not-for-profit organisations, set up to help members save or borrow – often offering short-term lending at more affordable rates than 'normal' payday lenders. Each has a 'common bond', which is the criteria you'd need to meet before you can join. This is essentially who the credit union is set up to help, for example residents of a certain town, or employees of a particular industry.

We've listed credit unions below where many people would qualify, though the Find Your Credit Union site searches over 380 credit unions and shows you which you may be able to join, based on your home or work postcode, employer and groups or associations you may be part of.

In addition, you can use the comparison service on Just Borrow or the Finding Finance site to find further national or local options.
