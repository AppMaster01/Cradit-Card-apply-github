## What to expect when you take out a Online loan

Here’s what you can expect if you’re considering taking out a payday loan.

### What you need to provide a payday lender

Generally, payday lenders will require proof that you have a:

*   regular income
*   bank account
*   permanent address

Before giving you a payday loan, payday lenders will require you to do one of the following:

*   fill out a form that will allow the lender to withdraw the total loan amount, including fees, directly from your bank account when the loan is due (also called a pre-authorized debit)
*   provide a post-dated cheque for the total loan amount including fees

Be careful when providing your banking information to a payday lender, as they will have access to funds in your account.

### Getting money from a payday lender

In most cases, the payday lender will deposit money in your bank account or give you cash.

However, in some cases, the payday lender may ask you to take the loan on a prepaid card. It may cost extra to activate and use the card.

### Paying back a payday loan

Some payday lenders require you to repay your loan at the same location where you got your loan. In several provinces, a payday lender can’t extend or roll over your payday loan.

### Make sure you understand the agreement

The payday lender will ask you to sign an agreement that shows your loan costs, including interest, fees and the due date. Read this document carefully before signing it. Ask the payday lender about anything you don’t understand.

### Online payday loans

Payday lenders may operate in a physical location or online. Be careful with online payday lenders, many aren't licensed and don't follow provincial rules designed to protect borrowers. You should only use licensed online payday lenders.

Beware of online payday lenders located outside Canada. If you have problems with them, it may be difficult to resolve.

Also, be careful with online sites that say they offer payday loans. Some will only collect your information and give it to an actual payday lender.
