## Online Loan Changes Retracted

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau introduced a series of regulation changes in 2017 that were supposed to protect borrowers by forcing the payday lenders to determine if the borrower could afford to take on a loan with a 391% interest rate.

However, the Trump administration rejected the argument that consumers needed protection. The CFPB has since decided it will remove the regulation altogether, though they promised to take public comment on it through June of 2020.

Here are the five changes to protect consumers that originally were approved, but now appear to be dead in the water.

### Full Payment Test

Payday lenders would have to verify the borrower’s income to determine whether he/she could cover basic financial obligations (housing, food, clothing, transportation) and have enough income to repay the loan. Lenders also would have to look at the borrower’s credit report to check for other loan obligations.

### Principal Payoff Option

This rule would limit the consumer to borrowing nor more than $500 if they couldn’t pass the “Full Payment Test.”

**Other restrictions include:**

*   Not allowing the lender to take the borrower’s car title as collateral for a loan.
*   Not allowing the lender to make a loan to a consumer who already has a short-term loan.
*   Restricting loan extensions to borrower who paid at least one-third of the principal owed on each extension.
*   Requiring lenders to disclose the Principal Payoff Option to all borrowers.

### Cooling Off Period

When borrowers can’t repay the original loan after two weeks, they often “Roll Over” the loan and are charged fees and interest again for an increased amount. This proposal said that there must be a 30-day “cooling off period” for borrowers who have taken out a loan and rolled it over twice, before they can request another loan.

### Mandatory Reporting

This regulation would have required lenders to report their loans to the three major credit reporting bureaus and update them as payments are made or not made.

### Alternate Options

Lenders would have been required to offer longer-term loans that would mean considerably less risk for borrowers. That would include an option to limit interest rates to 28% (APR). Another option would be to have fixed payments over a two-year period with an interest rate no higher than 36%.

Though the fate of the five changes hasn’t officially been decided, the CFPB appears to be headed in the direction of abandoning them, at least the part where payday lenders would have to do research to determine if the borrower could afford the loan.

## How Do Payday Loans Work?

Payday loans are a quick-fix solution for consumers in a financial crisis, but also are budget busting expenses for families and individuals.

**Here is how a payday loan works:**

*   Consumers fill out a registration form at a Payday lending office. Identification, a recent pay stub and bank account number are the only documents needed.
*   Loan amounts vary from $50 to as much as $1,000, depending on the law in your state. If approved, you receive cash on the spot.
*   Full payment is due on the borrower’s next payday, which typically is two weeks.
*   Borrowers either post-date a personal check to coincide with their next paycheck or give the payday lender electronic access to withdraw funds from the customer’s bank account.
*   Payday lenders usually charge interest of $15-$20 for every $100 borrowed. Calculated on an annual percentage rate basis (APR) – the same as is used for credit cards, mortgages, auto loans, etc. – that APR ranges from 391% to more than 521% for payday loans.
