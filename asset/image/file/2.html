## How Do Loans Work?

Payday loans are a quick-fix solution for consumers in a financial crisis, but also are budget busting expenses for families and individuals.

**Here is how a payday loan works:**

*   Consumers fill out a registration form at a Payday lending office. Identification, a recent pay stub and bank account number are the only documents needed.
*   Loan amounts vary from $50 to as much as $1,000, depending on the law in your state. If approved, you receive cash on the spot.
*   Full payment is due on the borrower’s next payday, which typically is two weeks.
*   Borrowers either post-date a personal check to coincide with their next paycheck or give the payday lender electronic access to withdraw funds from the customer’s bank account.
*   Payday lenders usually charge interest of $15-$20 for every $100 borrowed. Calculated on an annual percentage rate basis (APR) – the same as is used for credit cards, mortgages, auto loans, etc. – that APR ranges from 391% to more than 521% for payday loans.
