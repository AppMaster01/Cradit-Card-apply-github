# How Do Loans Work?

Payday loans have become the face of predatory lending in America for one reason: The interest rate on the average payday loan is 391%.

And that’s if you pay it back in two weeks!

If you can’t repay the loans – and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau says 80% of payday loans don’t get paid back in two weeks – then your interest rate soars to 521% and continues rising every time you can’t repay the debt.

Compare payday loan interest rates to the average rate for alternative choices like credit cards (15%-30%); debt management programs (8%-10%); personal loans (14%-35%) and online lending (10%-35%).

Nonetheless, research by the St. Louis Federal Reserve shows that more than 12 million Americans, mostly poor consumers without access to credit cards or bank loans, instead turn to payday lenders to solve short-term financial problems. In 2019, they borrowed $29 billion and paid an astonishing $9 billion in fees to do so, according to the Federal Reserve.
