## How much Online loans cost

Payday loans are very expensive compared to other ways of borrowing money.

This is because:

*   you pay high fees
*   the cost may be equivalent to an interest rate of 500-600%
*   you may have to pay a fee if your cheque or pre-authorized debit doesn't go through

These high costs can make your loan harder to pay back, which can increase your financial difficulties and stress.

Before taking out a payday loan, be very sure that you can pay it back on time. If not, your financial situation may get worse. Your debt can keep growing and you can end up paying a lot of money over time.

|--- |--- |
|Line of credit|$5.92|
|Overdraft protection on a bank account|$7.42|
|Cash advance on a credit card|$7.65|
|Payday loan|$51.00|

*   a payday loan costs $17 per $100 that you borrow, which is the same as an annual interest rate of 442%
*   a line of credit includes a $5 administration fee plus 8% annual interest on the amount you borrow
*   overdraft protection on a bank account includes a $5 fee plus 21% annual interest on the amount you borrow
*   a cash advance on a credit card includes a $5 fee plus 23% annual interest on the amount you borrow
