## What happens if you can’t pay back a Online loan on time

There can be serious consequences if you don’t repay your loan by the due date.

Depending on the laws in your province, these consequences may include the following:

*   the payday lender may charge you a fee if there isn’t enough money in your account
*   your financial institution may also charge you a fee if there isn’t enough money in your account
*   the total amount that you owe, including the fees, will continue to increase
*   the payday lender could call your friends, relatives or employer in attempts to contact you to collect the money
*   the payday lender could deal with a collection agency and this could be included on your credit report
*   the payday lender or collection agency could sue you for the debt
*   the payday lender or collection agency could seize your property
*   the payday lender could go to the courts to take money from your paycheques (also called garnishing your wages)

If you can’t make your payday loan payments on time, it can be easy to get stuck in a debt trap.

Infographic: Payday loans: An expensive way to borrow money!

The infographic Payday loans: An expensive way to borrow money! is illustrating an example of what can happen when you take out a payday loan.

You need $300 for household repairs. You get a $300 payday loan for 2 weeks. Over the 2-week period, you’ll pay $51 in charges, which is equivalent to a yearly interest rate of 442%. You owe $351.

If you don’t make your payment, you’re charged a $40 penalty. You now owe $391.

Before you make a decision, explore your options.

This example is for illustration purposes only. The $51 in charges is based on a cost of $17 per $100 borrowed. In provinces and territories where the cost is regulated, the maximum a Payday lender can charge is between $15 and $25 per $100 borrowed. Where the cost is not regulated, it can be higher. Penalty fees vary across provinces. Contact your provincial or territorial consumer affairs office for details.

## Options to consider before getting a payday loan

Will you be able to pay the loan back on time and cover your regular expenses? If not, consider the following other options that are less expensive than a payday loan.

### Cheques and hold periods

When you deposit a cheque in person at your bank, you have immediate access to the first $100 of all the money you deposited. You’ll have access to the $100 on the next business day if you make the deposit in any other way, such as at an ATM. If the cheque is for $100 or less, the bank must provide you with the entire amount.

### Cashing a Government of Canada cheque for free

The Government of Canada has temporarily increased the cheque-cashing limit to $2,000 for emergency benefits-related cheques to individuals.

You have the right to cash your Government of Canada cheque for free at any bank. You can do this even if you're not a customer of that bank. Your cheque must be for $1,500 or less. You need to show one piece of identification with both your photo and your signature, such as a driver’s license.

### Ask for more time to pay your bills

Consider contacting the people or businesses that you owe money to. Ask for more time to pay your bills. Tell them when you get paid and offer to write a post-dated cheque for that day.

### Consider cheaper ways of borrowing money

If you need the money immediately, look into less expensive alternatives.

For example:

*   cashing in vacation days
*   asking for a pay advance from your employer
*   getting a loan from family or friends
*   getting a line of credit from your financial institution
*   getting a cash advance on a credit card
*   getting a personal loan from your financial institution

#### Lines of credit

A line of credit allows you to withdraw money whenever you want, up to a certain credit limit. You pay interest on the amount you borrow until you pay it back in full.

#### Cash advances on a credit card

Unlike purchases, when you take a cash advance on a credit card, you’re charged interest right away. However, the interest rates you pay are much lower than with payday loans.

If you don’t have a credit card and you’ve had credit problems in the past, you may be able to get a secured credit card from a bank or other financial institution.

#### Personal loans

Personal loans let you borrow a fixed amount of money. You must pay back the loan, plus interest, over a fixed period of time.

### If you're stuck in a debt cycle

If you’re already having trouble making ends meet because you can’t make the payments on your debts, think carefully about the long-term consequences of taking out a payday loan.
