**FAQ**

**Q1 | What is the minimum and maximum period for repayment?**

Our minimum period (More than 60 days) and the maximum period for repayment is 18 months.

**Q2 | What is the maximum annual percentage rate (APR)?**

Under MONEYLENDERS RULES 2009, the maximum interest rate moneylenders can charge is 4% per month.

The computation of interest charged on the loan must be based on the amount of principal remaining after deducting from the original principal the total payments made by or on behalf of the borrower which are appropriated to the principal.

[To illustrate, if X takes a loan of $1,000, and X has repaid $400, only the remaining $600 can be taken into account for the computation of interest.]

**Q3 | Can I have a representative example of the total cost of the loan, including all applicable fees?**

To illustrate, if X takes a loan of $1,000 with a repayment period of 6 months

Principal Amount= $1,000  
Annual Interest= 47%

Repayment Period= 6 months  
Monthly Payment= (1000 * 0.47/12 ) / [ 1 – ( 1 + 0.47/12) ^ - 6 ]  
= $190.24

Total Cost= 1000 * 10% + ( 190.24 * 6 – 1000)  
= $241.44

*The cost is made up of a 10% administration fee and 4% monthly interest fee.

Total Repayable= $190.24 * 6  
= $1,141.44
