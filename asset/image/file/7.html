## What happens if you can’t pay back a Online loan on time

There can be serious consequences if you don’t repay your loan by the due date.

Depending on the laws in your province, these consequences may include the following:

*   the payday lender may charge you a fee if there isn’t enough money in your account
*   your financial institution may also charge you a fee if there isn’t enough money in your account
*   the total amount that you owe, including the fees, will continue to increase
*   the payday lender could call your friends, relatives or employer in attempts to contact you to collect the money
*   the payday lender could deal with a collection agency and this could be included on your credit report
*   the payday lender or collection agency could sue you for the debt
*   the payday lender or collection agency could seize your property
*   the payday lender could go to the courts to take money from your paycheques (also called garnishing your wages)

If you can’t make your payday loan payments on time, it can be easy to get stuck in a debt trap.

Infographic: Payday loans: An expensive way to borrow money!

The infographic Payday loans: An expensive way to borrow money! is illustrating an example of what can happen when you take out a payday loan.

You need $300 for household repairs. You get a $300 payday loan for 2 weeks. Over the 2-week period, you’ll pay $51 in charges, which is equivalent to a yearly interest rate of 442%. You owe $351.

If you don’t make your payment, you’re charged a $40 penalty. You now owe $391.

Before you make a decision, explore your options.

This example is for illustration purposes only. The $51 in charges is based on a cost of $17 per $100 borrowed. In provinces and territories where the cost is regulated, the maximum a Payday lender can charge is between $15 and $25 per $100 borrowed. Where the cost is not regulated, it can be higher. Penalty fees vary across provinces. Contact your provincial or territorial consumer affairs office for details.
