## How Online Loan Interest Rates Are Calculated

The annual percentage interest rate (APR) for payday loans is calculated by dividing the amount of interest paid by the amount borrowed; multiplying that by 365; divide that number by the length of repayment term; and multiply by 100.

In mathematical terms, the APR calculations on a $375 loan look like this: 56.25 รท 375 = .15 x 365 = 54.75 รท 14 = 3.91 x 100 = 391%.

For the $20 per $100 borrowed (or 20%) on a $375 loan, it looks like this: 75 รท 375 = .2 x 365 = 73 รท 14 = 5.21 x 100 = 521%.

Again, those APR as astronomically higher than any other lending offered. If you used a credit card instead, even at the highest credit card rate available, you are paying less than one-tenth the amount of interest that you would on a payday loan.
