## Short-term/payday loans

If the above options don't work for you or aren't right, you could consider a short-term payday loan. Please read each and every warning in here and consider your options very carefully before going ahead. 

### 1\. Borrow as little as possible and budget to pay it off as soon as you can

Many payday lenders give you the option to pay your loan back over three months rather than one. This can help with budgeting, in that you don't have to pay the loan back in one great whack once your next paycheck's arrived.

But, remember, the longer you borrow for, the more interest you'll have to pay. Most lenders will let you pay the loan off early. This means you could repay a three-month loan after just a few days or weeks, without paying any penalties - though double check before taking out loan if the lender charges any early repayment fees. The quicker you repay, the less interest you will rack up, so the overall cost will be much cheaper.

Even if you stick to the agreed repayment term, always, always have a plan for how you'll pay back the money. See How to Budge for help to manage your finances.

*   ### 2\. If you know you can't repay on time, avoid at all costs. If you later can't pay, tell your lender immediately

    If you do go for a payday loan, the crucial point is that you know how you are going to pay it back. If not, then you can't afford the loan. (If you're given one, you've been mis-sold. See our tool and guide in Reclaim Payday Loans for Free.) No matter how desperate you are, the end result will leave you much worse off.

    If you feel desperate and that it's your only option, even though you aren't sure you'll repay it, you'd be far better getting one-on-one debt counselling help from a non-profit debt counselling agency.

    ##### If you're later unable to pay, contact the lender immediately.

    If you take out a loan with a plan to pay it back and something later goes wrong so you can't, contact the lender as soon as you can and ask it for help. 

    Always, always tell your lender as soon as you know you're not going to be able to repay. It does work. Be firm, make a fair offer and be willing to answer questions about your income and expenditure honestly.

    It should then offer you a fair and affordable way to repay, such as a structured repayment plan and the freezing of interest and charges, 

*   ### 3\. Don't take out a payday loan to repay another. If you're regularly getting payday loans there's a problem

    Payday loans should never be used as a way to fill the gap between your incomings and outgoings each and every month. If that's happening to you, there's a fundamental problem that a payday loan will only make worse not better. An irresponsible lender will take advantage of this. If this is happening, you've been mis-sold. Go to our free tool and guide Reclaim Payday Loans for Free.

    To stop being sucked in a downward spiral, the most important thing to do is to sort out a budget to try to balance your costs and income.

    It's easy to be tempted to get one payday loan for a small amount, then another the next month, and before you know it, you're in a debt spiral. See this story from forumite _leopardxgirl_ as a stark warning.

    _About 8 months ago I borrowed around £90 to pay for a train ticket to see my now ex-boyfriend. What a slippery slope that was. I'm now approx £3,500 into payday loans across four payday lenders. I seem to have got myself into a horrible situation where I can only barely afford the interest repayments on these darn things every month._

*   ### 4\. Payday loans can hit your ability to get a mortgage - even if paid on time

    Apply for any credit, and lenders 'score' you to predict your likely behaviour. They use data from credit reference agencies as part of this (see the Credit Scores guide). But a payday loan on your credit report can have a striking effect. All credit reference agencies differentiate payday loans on your credit report. They’re in a different section, so underwriters (who make lending decisions) can tell how much and how often you've used payday loans.

    ##### Can a payday loan stop me getting a mortgage?

    A few mortgage lenders have publicly said applicants who have used payday loans won't be accepted for a mortgage with them - even if they were fully repaid on time.

    Yet even those who haven’t spoken up are likely to behave in a similar way. One of the UK’s top technical experts on mortgages, Ray Boulger from broker John Charcol, says:

    _Most lenders will run a mile if an applicant has had even one payday loan in the last year._

    This is because the presence of a payday loan on the credit record of a mortgage applicant implies there's some underlying problem with their budgeting and money management. That throws serious doubt on their ability to consistently meet a monthly mortgage payment.

*   ##### I've seen adverts saying a payday loan can improve my credit rating. Is that true?

    Some payday loan firms claim getting it has a positive effect.

    Of course, if you get a payday loan, paying it in full and on time is important. It'll certainly give you a relatively better score than not doing so. Similarly, missing a payment or late payments will harm your credit score.

    Yet payday lenders' claims that getting one will help your credit score are likely to be overblown. It can boost indicative scores from the credit rating agencies – but this isn't the same as making lenders more likely to give you conventional credit cards or loans.

    Each lender scores you differently, based on its own wishlist of what makes a profitable customer. Some will see a marginal improvement from payday loans – but equally, others may follow the path of mortgage lenders and see it as a big no-no.

    If you need to rebuild a bad credit history there are other, better ways to do that, with specific Credit Cards for Bad Credit.

*   ### 5\. They are an expensive form of borrowing, though there is a cap on charges and interest

    There are three elements to this cap:

    *   Lenders can only charge 80p interest per £100 per day (0.8%). So, if you borrowed £100 for 30 days, you shouldn't pay more than £24 in interest.

    *   Lenders can't charge more than £15 as a fee if you pay late.

    *   You'll never pay back more than double what you borrowed. So, if you borrow £100, you will never pay back more than £200 when all interest, late fees and charges are taken into account.

        This is more relevant than the APR you'll see displayed. This stands for the Annual Percentage Rate, and essentially tells you the cost of borrowing if you were to have it over a year. 

        As you're borrowing over a short period, even a small fee can become an astronomical APR. Payday loans are expensive but if you express the typical charges payday lenders make as APRs most work out as over 1,000%. This is a useful warning against what can be dangerous products, but these APRs are mostly meaningless.

    *   ##### What exactly is APR?

        APR stands for the Annual Percentage Rate, and it's the official rate used for borrowing. When it's calculated it has to include:

        *   The cost of the borrowing, so the amount of interest charged _plus_
        *   Any associated fees that are automatically included, such as an application or annual fee

        An APR is therefore meant to give you the overall equivalent cost of a debt, which you can then use to compare against other credit and loan products. It must be displayed by a lender before any agreement is signed. 

    *   ##### Why do they have to put these APRs if they're meaningless?

        Well, it's a legal requirement that if you're offering loans to people, then you have to have your APR marked in large letters on all adverts, and on your website.

        But, many have pointed out the pointlessness of this with a payday loan. APR stands for 'annual percentage rate'. Put simply, it's the rate you pay on what you've borrowed over a year, including all interest and charges.

        But, here's where it falls down. Payday loans are usually taken out for a matter of weeks, rather than for years. So, the amount you will have to pay back is really more relevant than the APR for these loans. See Martin's blog on how an APR can confuse as much as it can clarify what's really going on.  

*   ### 6\. Every legitimate lender will do a credit check and check you can repay. Avoid any that claim it won't

    Some, especially smaller, payday lenders don't share your payment data with credit reference agencies. These are generally the ones that advertise "payday loans with no credit checks".

    This can seem like a good thing, as it won't "ruin" your credit rating by putting the payday loan on your file (though a future lender could ask you).

    But it also means the payday lender's not lending responsibly as it's not checking you can afford to repay. It also means other lenders won't be able to see the loan, so as a consequence, their lending may not be responsible either. Irresponsible lending is mis-selling. See our free tool and guide Reclaim Payday Loans for Free.

    The 'responsible' payday lenders - the ones which credit check each applicant – say they turn down between 60% and 90% of first-time applicants because their credit records show they're already too indebted to have a good chance of paying their loans back.

    Think carefully if you're going to a payday lender because it advertises 'no credit checks'. Can you really afford to repay it?

*   ### The lender will have authorised access to take money from your bank account

    A common tactic of payday lenders is to ask you to pay using something called a continuous payment authority (CPA, also known as a recurring payment). This is where you tell it the 16-digit number on the front of your card. This gives the lender the right to automatically take a payment, though it's limited to two attempts to collect payment, and should only be taken on the day it is due. It can only claim the full payment required, rather than part-payments, but it can be dangerous, especially if you have other, more important bills to pay.

    *   

        ##### How can I cancel a Continuous Payment Authority?

        You have a right to cancel CPAs simply by asking the bank which runs your account. See the Recurring Payments guide for full help. We're not suggesting to cancel this and not repay, but the lack of control these types of payments give you is scary - it can be far better to call them and pay up as and when you owe the money.

*   ### 8.Always check a lender is registered with the FCA first. Payday lenders can be bad – loan sharks are MUCH worse

    Payday loan companies, though they may lay traps for you, are authorised by the FCA (check at the FCA Register). So if things go wrong, you have some limited room for recourse. But loan sharks are a completely different beast. They're unlicensed, they break the law, often go knocking door-to-door and at worst they use horrific methods - including violence and threats of violence against the borrower, their family or children - to get their money repaid.

    *   ##### How do I report an illegal loan shark?

        If you know of loan sharks near you, report them on 0300 555 2222 – you can also text LOAN SHARK and lender's details to 60003, visit StopLoanSharks or download its app (England only). If you're elsewhere in the UK, contact details to report loan sharks are on the Government's Report a Loan Shark page.

        When borrowing, always check whether the lender is authorised by the FCA.

### How to find and compare short-term loans

If you've jumped straight here - please read the cheaper alternatives first. Payday loans are expensive and should be considered as a last resort.

If you still feel a payday loan is right for you, this information will help you find and compare short-term loans.  

First, here are our key need-to-knows before comparing lenders.

*   **Find out the real price to you.** Charges vary from company to company. On average, it's around £24 per month per £100 borrowed. Yet there's no one cheapest here, as it depends on the exact amount and length of borrowing. So always ensure you know: _A. What you repay if you repay on time_ – compare based on that. _B. Just in case - what would happen if you couldn't repay?_ If this is a realistic possibility (obviously we'd prefer you didn't get a loan at all in these circumstances), factor this into your decision very carefully.

*   **Watch out for payday loan brokers.** Payday loan brokers will look like payday lenders, but they won't be able to lend to you. Instead, they'll charge you a fee for referring your application to a payday lender. If you are going for a payday loan (and make sure you've checked none of the alternatives above are suitable first), don't fall for this scam. 

*   **Ensure the company is legit.** Adverts for payday loans are everywhere - especially online, so it's tricky to know where to go. Before applying, check the company's registered with the FCA. It's important to do this as some payday lenders operate illegally.

*   **Make sure you know the application criteria.** This varies from lender to lender, but you'll need to be over 18 years old, have a full bank account with debit card, a regular income and with most payday lenders you will have to pass a credit check (some say they reject as many as two-thirds of first time applicants). You'll also need some proof of your identity and your income.

*   **Watch out for marketing opt-ins.** Some lenders have marketing opt-outs/ins on their application forms. If you say you're happy to hear from them and 'selected' third parties, then it means they're able to sell your data to whoever they like. Always make sure you say no to marketing.

#### If you've read all the warnings above and are still sure a payday loan is right, these short-term loan comparison sites at least compare multiple loans...

All the lenders and Choose Wisely compare a range of short-term lenders. Though be warned, these sites still contain VERY expensive loans, so use them at your own risk.

Neither will compare every loan provider, though both do have an eligibility checker which will show you which lenders are likely to accept you. This uses a soft search check, so won't impact your credit score. However if you then go on to apply, this will leave a search that other lenders can see.

You can compare loans with a minimum term of three months, though look for lenders that allow you to pay off the loan early without penalty – remember the quicker you can clear the loan, the less interest you'll pay.  

## Want to complain about your loan provider?

If your loan provider has charged you the wrong amount, taken the wrong amount in payment, or its service has been atrocious, then you don't have to suffer in silence. It's always worth trying to call your lender first to see if it can help, but if it can't (or won't), or it doesn't get back to you...
