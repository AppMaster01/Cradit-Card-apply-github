## Do you really NEED to borrow?

If you're struggling for extra cash, there's a heap of options to try before plumping for a payday loan. In fact, you may not need to borrow at all.

First of all, take a look at the following...

### Do you need it? Try Martin's Money Mantras

If you're getting a payday loan because you need to buy something, you need to consider if that purchase is appropriate. Martin has two Money Mantras: one for if you're skint, one for those not skint. If you're getting a payday loan we will assume you're skint, or you shouldn't even be considering getting one.

In which case, before you buy anything ask yourself these three questions…

1.  Do I _need_it?

2.  Can I _afford_ it?

3.  Have I checked whether I can buy it cheaper elsewhere?

**If the answer to any of these is 'no', then don't buy it.**

*   ### Flog your stuff for cash

    Shops and business do stock control, considering their assets as cash, ensuring they're utilised. We need to adopt a similar system. If you've things in your house you've not used or worn in a year, ask if it's worth keeping. If not, flog it and release the assets.

    Even if there are things you use occasionally, if you're considering getting a payday loan – are you sure there aren't things you can sell? Old gadgets, clothes, toys or other old items you have sitting around at home could raise the cash you need without affecting you too much.

    If it's old mobiles or gadgets, use Compare Mobile Buying Sites to find top prices. For other things, see our eBay Selling and Flog What You've Got tips.

*   ### Check this isn't just a budgeting problem

    Payday loans may seem to offer a quick solution, but they only postpone the problem. If you've borrowed £200 this month, and £250 (repaying the loan plus interest) is taken out of your salary on your next payday, how are you going to make sure you're not short again at the end of next month?

    Spending more money than you earn is a classic reason people get payday loans. Doing a proper budget will give you a clear picture of where you are overspending.

    Use our full online Budget Planner – get all your bank account and credit card statements, plus bills from the last six months to a year. Ensure you include everything and are totally honest.

    Plus look at everything you spend money on, whether car insurance, existing credit card debts, gas and electricity, or water bills and see if you're paying more than you need. Full help on this in our Money Makeover guide.

*   ### What could you give up to find the cash?

    Whether it's coffee, cigarettes, or walking instead of getting the bus – small savings can quickly add up. Try the Demotivator to see how much you can save.

*   ### Earn under £73,000? Check if you're entitled to any benefits

    Even if you don't think you're due any benefits, or if you're already claiming, it's worth checking to see if you could be eligible to claim payments.

    The main thing to remember is benefits are NOT just for the unemployed. Many families are entitled to Government cash but aren't aware they're eligible. In some cases, even those earning up to £73,000 may get help. See the Benefits Check-Up guide to see if you're eligible.

*   ### Reclaim, reclaim, reclaim – you may be owed cash!

    Over the last few years, a number of ways that banks, insurers and arms of government have unfairly taken cash off us have emerged. This money can be reclaimed, and can be in the £1,000s, or even £10,000s, but you need to take action to get it back. If you’ve had a payday loan in the past it may have been mis-sold, see our Reclaim Payday Loans for Free for more info.

    ### Check for grants and support

    We've listed details of help available from energy companies if you've large arrears on your gas, electricity or water bills below, though see our Housing & Energy Grants guide for full info.

    *   **Gas & Electricity**: To apply for help with energy arrears, you'll usually need to be an account holder and complete a full income and expenditure budget sheet. You'll also need to provide proof of your income, plus give details on how your arrears have built up, eg, due to illness or redundancy, and say how the grant will help you. It can take several weeks to process your claim.  

        Exact requirements vary – some say you need to be in receipt of certain benefits for example – but those with the greatest need are prioritised on a case-by-case basis.
