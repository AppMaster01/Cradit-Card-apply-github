## How Online Loan Finance Charges Are Calculated

The average payday loan in 2020 was $375\. The average interest – or “finance charge” as payday lenders refer to it – for a $375 loan would be between $56.25 and $75, depending on the terms you accept.

That interest/finance charge typically is somewhere between 15% and 20%, depending on the lender, but could be higher. State laws regulate the maximum interest a payday lender may charge.

The amount of interest paid is calculated by multiplying the amount borrowed by the interest charge.

From a mathematical standpoint, it looks like this for a 15% loan: 375 x .15 = 56.25\. If you accepted terms of $20 per $100 borrowed (20%), it would look like this: 375 x .20 = 75.

That means you must pay $56.25 to borrow $375\. That is an interest rate of 391% APR. If you pay $20 per $100 borrowed, you pay a finance charge of $75 and an interest rate of 521% APR.
