## What to ask a Online lender

Ask the payday lender about the total cost of borrowing when you first apply for the loan.

Be sure to find out:

*   all the fees, charges and interest
*   the date the loan is due
*   if there is a maximum cost you can be charged for a payday loan

Ask about fees applied if you’re unable to pay back your loan on time.

Understand that:

*   a fee is often charged if your cheque or pre-authorized debit is returned due to non-sufficient funds
*   these fees can range from $20 to $50
*   many provinces have rules about maximum fees for non-sufficient funds
*   the amount can be much higher in provinces and territories where the fee is unregulated

Ask if there is a “cooling off” period. This is a period, often a day or two, during which you can cancel the loan with no explanation and without paying any fees. The laws in many provinces protect this right. Make sure to get the “cooling off” period information in writing from the payday lender.

Ask for a copy of the loan agreement.

Make sure you:

*   read this document carefully before signing it
*   understand the total cost of the loan
*   keep a copy for your records so that you have something to refer to if there’s any problem
*   don’t sign for the loan if the lender won’t give you a copy of the agreement
